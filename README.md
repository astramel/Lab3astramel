## Problem 1
n=10
sum=55
## Problem 2

When n = 300, the prgram produces a negative value of -20386, which is an overflow.
## Problem 3

The value of n= 90000 causes an overflow with type long is and returns  -244922296.

## Problem 4
An overflow is detected when a value that was inputted returns an inaccurate result. The value of n = 1000, which produces inf, which is wrong.

## Problem 5
Using n = 6000, which cases an overflow due to the output resulting as inf.

## Problem 6
When the result is a negative number that is when we know how to detect an overflow. I am using a MacBook, they are 8 bits versus Windows that uses 4 bits, so I had to use a larger number. The actual number should have been 0, the computer introduces errors when it rounds when it rounds fractions, that is why the number is not 0.

## Problem 7
The numeric error occurs when 4.4 is displayed which shoud not happen because of the lopp because it states that i < 4.4, not i <= 4.4. This error is occuring because type float is not as accurate which why 4.4 shows up.


## Problem 8
When using double than a float, which fixes this issue because type double is more accurate.
